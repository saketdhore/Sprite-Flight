# Sprite Flight

**Sprite Flight** is a personal follow-along project created to learn the fundamentals of game development and Unity.
It follows a Unity tutorial series from *Unity Learn* and serves as a hands-on way to understand core concepts such as:

* 2D game mechanics
* Physics and collisions
* Player and obstacle scripting
* Scene management and UI basics

This repository contains all scripts and assets used while progressing through the tutorial, along with any modifications made to explore additional features or improve understanding of the engine.
